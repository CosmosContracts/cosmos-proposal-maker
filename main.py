## Increase Juno's Deposit Minimum

[Commonwealth Thread](https://commonwealth.im/juno/discussion/11579-increase-governance-deposit-to-5000juno)

With the decline in JUNO's price the past few months, we have seen an uptick in scam proposals making it to voting period. With this, this proposal will update Juno's current governance deposit from 1000JUNO to 5000JUNO if passed.
Currently this includes: 296, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303. All of these are used to phish for users wallet mnemonics and drain their personal funds. 

By increasing this, it increases the cost of the attack which makes it unprofitable to execute on.
The minimum deposit rate to enter deposit period will remain at the same at 20%, which would now be 1000 JUNO.

If you do not have enough Juno to make a proposal, you can reach out to a Core-1, Core-2, or SubDAO to help get your proposal live.
