# Juno {UPGRADE_HUMAN_NAME} Upgrade ({UPGRADE_NAME})

[{UPGRADE_HUMAN_NAME} Article](https://medium.com/@JunoNetwork/pioneering-continues-a-status-update-on-the-upcoming-upgrade-invictus-29ce631cf99f)

This upgrade brings the following major changes to Juno Network:
- x/drip module (single block stake weighted airdrop for all delegators).
- x/clock module (Allow smart contracts to 'tick' every end block)
- 3 second block times (down from 6 seconds).

Other:
- DAODAO can now natively register contracts with FeeShare if it is the admin or creator.
- We now bypass IBC transactions up to 2M gas (from 1 million) due to the use of TFM with PFM & IBC Hooks.
